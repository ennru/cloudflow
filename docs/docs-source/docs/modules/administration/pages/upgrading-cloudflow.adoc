Upgrading Cloudflow after a new release is done using the Helm upgrade command, the command will upgrade Cloudflow to the latest version.

== Upgrading

To upgrade Cloudflow in your cluster run
----
  helm upgrade cloudflow cloudflow-helm-charts/cloudflow \
    --namespace cloudflow \
    --reuse-values
----

== Selection a specific version

To upgrade Cloudflow to a specific version, add the _--version_ flag. For example:

[source,shell script,subs="attributes"]
----
  helm upgrade cloudflow cloudflow-helm-charts/cloudflow \
    --namespace cloudflow \
    --reuse-values \
    --version="{cloudflow-version}"
----

IMPORTANT: A typical upgrade of Cloudflow does not affect the running Cloudflow applications. However, always check the release notes to be sure there are no breaking changes.
